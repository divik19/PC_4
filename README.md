### Consumer Goods Ad_hoc Insights
**Domain**:  Consumer Goods | **Function**: Executive Management

**Situation:**  
Atliq Hardware, a leading computer hardware producer in India, identified the need for more insightful data to support quick and smart decision-making. The management sought to address ten ad-hoc requests by deriving key insights from their data and presenting them in a comprehensive, easily digestible format.

**Task:**  
I was tasked with answering the ad-hoc business questions through SQL queries, analyzing the results, and presenting insights to senior management. Additionally, I was responsible for creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize these insights and assist in decision-making.

**Action:**  
- **Data Extraction and Analysis:**  
  Used SQL to extract relevant data from multiple tables including `dim_customer`, `dim_product`, `fact_sales_monthly`, and `fact_manufacturing_cost`. I ran queries to answer key questions such as product performance, sales trends, and manufacturing costs.
  
- **SQL Techniques:**  
  Leveraged advanced SQL concepts like **CTEs**, **joins**, **window functions**, **group by**, and **aggregate functions** to calculate product growth, sales performance, and customer discount trends.
  

**Result:**  
- **Insightful Reports:**  
  Delivered actionable insights such as a **36.33% increase in unique products** from 2020 to 2021 and a dominant **73.22% sales contribution from the Retailer channel**.
  
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:**  
  Enabled management to identify high-performing segments (e.g., **Notebook segment**), optimize sales strategies (e.g., focus on **Storage, Networking, and Desktop**), and adjust pricing strategies based on **Flipkartâ€™s discount trends**.
  
- **Informed Strategy:**  
  The comprehensive dashboard allowed senior management to make informed decisions regarding product focus, manufacturing cost analysis, and sales strategy improvements.
